1.ROS
step1:
$ source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash
$ mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/
$ catkin_make
$ source devel/setup.bash
$ echo $ROS_PACKAGE_PATH
step2:
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src/ #use your current catkin folder
$ git clone https://github.com/stereolabs/zed-ros-wrapper.git
$ cd ..
$ catkin_make -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
$ echo source $(pwd)/devel/setup.bash >> ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc
step3:
$ roslaunch zed_wrapper zed.launch

2.Opencv
step1:after running ROS, cannot run Opencv,using following method：

Because of the effect from ROS，ROS will add the following path to python ：

'/opt/ros/kinetic/lib/python2.7/dist-packages'

to solve this problem，in any python files you need to run（file that needs to use import cv2），add folloing codes：

import sys
sys.path.remove('/opt/ros/kinetic/lib/python2.7/dist-packages')

through this two line codes, we erase the python path，so we can import cv2
step2:
open the terminal in the place where you put your zed-opencv.py file
python3 zed-opencv.py /home/hotfinda/document/ZED/3.svo
3.Tensorflow
1）before using tensorflow，run the following command everytime
)**# From tensorflow/models/research/**
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:`pwd`:`pwd`/slim
2）jump to ~/tensorflow/models/research, run the following code to check if the environment configuration is successful
python object_detection/builders/model_builder_test.py
3）read this link before carrying more steps：
https://github.com/stereolabs/zed-python-api
you may find a problem about pathlib,try using the following link
https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck/issues/287
if you find a problem about"pyzed persion denied"：using sudo before you write command
4）if the environment configuration is successful, jump to /home/hotfinda/tensorflow/zed-tensorflow-master, you will finish the obstacles detection：
$ python /home/hotfinda/tensorflow/zed-tensorflow-master/object_detection_zed.py
